## 🎯 Overview

This project visualizes SVG drawings using rotating vectors, called epicycles, based on their Fourier coefficients. It supports multi-path SVGs and animates each disjoint curve simultaneously. This technique bridges signal processing with artistic visualization.

## 🧠 Theory

Fourier Series allows us to represent any periodic signal as a sum of sinusoids. In our case, we treat an SVG path as a complex signal:

- A point (x, y) is represented as z = x + iy.
- The full path becomes a list of complex numbers sampled over time.
- Using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), we obtain frequency-domain coefficients.
- Each coefficient corresponds to a rotating vector (epicycle).
- By drawing these epicycles over time, we reconstruct the original path dynamically.

This method captures both the frequency and phase information of the signal, making it ideal for smooth and accurate path reconstructions.
